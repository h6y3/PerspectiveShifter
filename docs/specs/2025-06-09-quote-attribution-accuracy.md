# Quote Attribution Accuracy Enhancement

**Feature**: Enhanced Quote Attribution for Character vs. Author Distinction  
**Date**: 2025-06-09  
**Status**: Specification Complete - Ready for Implementation  
**Priority**: High  

## Overview

Currently, PerspectiveShifter may generate quotes from fictional characters but attribute them directly to the author, creating ambiguity about who actually "said" the quote. This enhancement will distinguish between character quotes and author quotes, providing accurate attribution that follows industry standards from platforms like Goodreads and BrainyQuote.

### Problem Statement

The quote "In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since" is currently attributed to "F. Scott Fitzgerald" when it should be attributed to "F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby (Nick Carraway)" since it's spoken by the fictional character Nick Carraway, not the author directly.

## Feature Scope and Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Accurate Attribution**: Distinguish between author direct quotes and character quotes from fictional works
2. **Space-Aware Formatting**: Implement attribution format that fits within image generation constraints  
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing cached quotes continue to work without modification
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to simple author attribution when space is limited

### Success Metrics
- All new fictional character quotes include proper attribution format
- Image generation maintains visual quality with longer attribution text
- Zero breaking changes to existing functionality
- OpenAI prompt modifications improve attribution accuracy

## Implementation Approach

### Attribution Display Format

**Standard Format**: `Author, Work Title (Character Name)`

**Examples**:
- Character quote: "F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby (Nick Carraway)"
- Author direct quote: "F. Scott Fitzgerald" 
- Space-constrained fallback: "F. Scott Fitzgerald"

**Character Limits**:
- Maximum attribution length: **65 characters** (based on 32px font, 700px available space)
- If formatted attribution exceeds 65 characters, fallback to author name only

### OpenAI Integration Enhancement

**New JSON Response Fields**:
```json
{
  "quote": "In my younger and more vulnerable years...",
  "attribution": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
  "speaker_type": "character",
  "speaker_name": "Nick Carraway", 
  "work_title": "The Great Gatsby",
  "is_fictional_work": true,
  "perspective": "...",
  "context": "..."
}
```

**Speaker Types**:
- `"author"`: Direct quote from the author
- `"character"`: Quote spoken by a fictional character
- `"narrator"`: Quote from an unnamed narrator
- `"unknown"`: Attribution unclear or anonymous

**Prompt Engineering Strategy**:
Enhance existing OpenAI prompt to request these fields explicitly, allowing the AI to determine the source type and provide necessary metadata for accurate attribution formatting.

### Database Schema Enhancement

**New Column**: `QuoteCache.attribution_metadata`
- Type: `TEXT` (nullable)
- Content: JSON string containing attribution metadata
- Purpose: Store speaker_type, speaker_name, work_title, is_fictional_work for enhanced attribution

**Example Metadata**:
```json
{
  "speaker_type": "character",
  "speaker_name": "Nick Carraway",
  "work_title": "The Great Gatsby", 
  "is_fictional_work": true
}
```

### Attribution Rendering Logic

**Implementation Location**: `openai_service.py` and `image_generator.py`

**Rendering Algorithm**:
1. If `attribution_metadata` exists and `speaker_type` == "character":
   - Format: `{attribution}, {work_title} ({speaker_name})`
   - If length > 65 chars: try `{attribution}, {work_title}`
   - If still > 65 chars: use `{attribution}` only
2. If `attribution_metadata` missing or `speaker_type` == "author":
   - Use existing `attribution` field
3. Handle edge cases gracefully with fallbacks

## Technical Implementation Details

### Code Changes Required

**1. Database Migration**
```sql
ALTER TABLE quote_cache ADD COLUMN attribution_metadata TEXT NULL;
```

**2. OpenAI Service Enhancement (`openai_service.py`)**
- Modify prompt to request speaker metadata
- Parse new response fields 
- Implement attribution formatting logic
- Store metadata in database when available

**3. Image Generation Updates (`image_generator.py`)**
- No changes required - uses existing `attribution` parameter
- Attribution formatting handled in OpenAI service before image generation

**4. Route Handler Updates (`routes.py`)**
- No changes required - existing flow continues to work
- Enhanced attribution passed through existing parameters

### Prompt Engineering Specifications

**Enhanced Prompt Addition**:
```
For attribution accuracy, also provide:
- speaker_type: "author" if the author said this directly, "character" if a fictional character said it, "narrator" for unnamed narrators
- speaker_name: name of the character who spoke this (if speaker_type is "character")
- work_title: title of the book/work if this is from a specific work
- is_fictional_work: true if this quote is from a novel/fictional work, false otherwise
```

**JSON Schema Enforcement**:
Ensure OpenAI response validation includes the new fields while maintaining backward compatibility with existing response format.

## Rollback and Migration Considerations

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
- **Existing Quotes**: Continue to work unchanged (attribution_metadata is nullable)
- **Legacy Display**: Code gracefully handles missing metadata
- **API Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing endpoints
- **Image Generation**: Existing images continue to render properly

### Rollback Plan
1. **Database**: Column can be dropped without affecting core functionality
2. **Code**: Changes are additive - removing enhancements reverts to current behavior
3. **OpenAI**: Prompt can be reverted to original format
4. **Zero Downtime**: All changes are non-breaking

### Migration Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Deploy database schema change (nullable column)
- **Phase 2**: Deploy enhanced OpenAI prompting and attribution logic
- **Phase 3**: Monitor and validate attribution accuracy improvements
- **No Data Migration**: Existing cached quotes remain functional

## Testing and Validation Criteria

### Unit Tests Required
- Attribution formatting logic with various input combinations
- Character limit handling and fallback behavior
- Metadata parsing and JSON validation
- Edge case handling (missing fields, malformed data)

### Integration Tests Required  
- OpenAI response parsing with new fields
- Database storage and retrieval of attribution metadata
- End-to-end quote generation with enhanced attribution
- Image generation with longer attribution text

### Manual Validation Criteria
- Generate quotes from well-known fictional characters (Harry Potter, Pride and Prejudice, etc.)
- Verify attribution format matches specification
- Test image generation with various attribution lengths
- Confirm fallback behavior when space constraints are exceeded

### Edge Cases to Test
- Very long book titles that exceed character limits
- Multiple character dialogue scenarios
- Anonymous or disputed attributions
- Non-English character names and book titles
- OpenAI failing to provide metadata (graceful degradation)

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Implementation Risks
1. **OpenAI Prompt Changes**: May affect quote quality or response reliability
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing before deployment, ability to revert prompt
2. **Attribution Length**: Longer attributions may affect image visual design
   - **Mitigation**: Character limits with fallback logic, design testing
3. **Performance Impact**: Additional JSON parsing and formatting logic
   - **Mitigation**: Minimal computational overhead, efficient implementation

### Business Risks
1. **User Confusion**: Different attribution formats may confuse existing users
   - **Mitigation**: Enhanced accuracy improves user trust, gradual rollout possible
2. **Content Quality**: AI may make errors in speaker type determination
   - **Mitigation**: Conservative fallback to existing attribution when uncertain
