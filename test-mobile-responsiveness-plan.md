## Automated Mobile Testing

### Chrome DevTools Responsive Testing
```javascript
// Console commands for responsive testing
// Test different viewport sizes
['375x667', '390x844', '414x896', '768x1024'].forEach(size => {
  const [width, height] = size.split('x');
  console.log(`Testing ${size}...`);
  // Manual viewport change required
});

// Test sharing button accessibility
document.querySelectorAll('.share-btn').forEach(btn => {
  const rect = btn.getBoundingClientRect();
  console.log(`Button ${btn.textContent}: ${rect.width}x${rect.height}`);
  if (rect.height < 44) console.warn('Button too small for touch!');
});
```

### Mobile Testing Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Mobile responsive testing checklist
echo "üì± Starting mobile responsive tests..."

# Test with different user agents
USER_AGENTS=(
  "Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 15_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15"
  "Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 11; SM-G991B) AppleWebKit/537.36"
)

for agent in "${USER_AGENTS[@]}"; do
  echo "Testing with: $agent"
  curl -H "User-Agent: $agent" -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" localhost:5000
